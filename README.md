Credit Card Fraud Detection
Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card datasets. The goal is to minimize financial losses for users and banks by identifying suspicious activities based on historical transaction data.

Features
Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis to identify trends and insights from the dataset.
Preprocessing: Handling missing values, balancing the dataset, and feature scaling.
Modeling: Training various machine learning models to predict fraud with high accuracy.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Dataset
The dataset contains anonymized credit card transaction data, including:

Features: Numerical attributes derived from PCA transformations.
Target Variable: 0 (Non-fraudulent) and 1 (Fraudulent).
Class Imbalance: The dataset is highly imbalanced, with very few fraudulent transactions compared to non-fraudulent ones.
Dataset Source: Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
